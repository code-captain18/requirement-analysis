# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

---

## 🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is a structured process in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** where the project team works with stakeholders to **identify, analyze, document, and validate** the needs and expectations for a software system.  

It serves as the **foundation** for design, development, and testing, ensuring the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations.

### ✨ Key Aspects of Requirement Analysis
- **Identification of Needs**: Capturing what the stakeholders expect the system to do.  
- **Analysis of Requirements**: Evaluating feasibility, consistency, and completeness of requirements.  
- **Documentation**: Creating requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.  
- **Validation**: Ensuring requirements are accurate, testable, and approved by stakeholders.  

### 📌 Importance in SDLC
- **Reduces Ambiguity**: Clearly defines system behavior, avoiding misunderstandings later.  
- **Defines Scope**: Prevents scope creep by establishing boundaries early.  
- **Guides Design & Development**: Provides the blueprint for system architecture and coding.  
- **Improves Cost & Time Estimation**: Accurate requirements enable realistic planning of effort and resources.  
- **Ensures Quality Delivery**: Validated requirements ensure the final product meets user and business needs.  

In essence, Requirement Analysis acts as the **bridge** between business expectations and technical implementation, ensuring software projects are **successful, cost-efficient, and user-centered**.

## 🔎 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Clarity and Understanding**: Helps in understanding what stakeholders expect, reducing ambiguity.  
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines the scope of the project, preventing scope creep.  
- **Basis for Design and Development**: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.  
- **Cost and Time Estimation**: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.  
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures the final product meets specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### 1. Requirement Gathering
- **Interviews**: One-on-one discussions with stakeholders to understand needs.  
- **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Collecting input from a broader audience efficiently.  
- **Workshops**: Collaborative sessions with stakeholders for in-depth exploration.  
- **Observation**: Watching end-users in action to identify real-world needs.  
- **Document Analysis**: Reviewing existing materials to understand current systems.  

### 2. Requirement Elicitation
- **Brainstorming**: Generating ideas collaboratively to identify potential requirements.  
- **Focus Groups**: Engaging selected stakeholders for detailed insights.  
- **Prototyping**: Developing mock-ups to help stakeholders visualize and refine requirements.  

### 3. Requirement Documentation
- **Requirement Specification Document**: Detailed listing of functional & non-functional requirements.  
- **User Stories**: Descriptions of features from the user's perspective.  
- **Use Cases**: Diagrams illustrating how users interact with the system.  

### 4. Requirement Analysis & Modeling
- **Requirement Prioritization**: Ranking requirements by importance and impact.  
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Evaluating based on technical, financial, and time constraints.  
- **Modeling**: Using diagrams (e.g., DFDs, ER diagrams) to represent requirements visually.  

### 5. Requirement Validation
- **Review & Approval**: Verifying requirements with stakeholders.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Setting clear standards each requirement must meet.  
- **Traceability**: Ensuring all requirements are tracked through development and testing.

## 📑 Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define **what the system must do** (specific behaviors or functions):

- **Search for hotels**: Users must be able to search for hotels and retrieve results based on location, availability, and recommendations via CDN & Elasticsearch.  
- **Book a room**: Users can select a hotel and complete a booking through the booking service, interacting with payment services and updating availability in the booking DB & Redis cache.  
- **View bookings**: Users and managers can view booking details using the View Booking Service, retrieving from Redis (recent) or Cassandra (historic).  
- **Notify stakeholders**: Automatic notifications sent (e.g., to managers when a booking occurs, or to customers about offers) via messaging queue events.  

### Non-Functional Requirements
These define **how the system should behave** (qualities, performance, constraints):

- **Scalability & High Availability**: Microservices, load balancers, containerized services, and replicated databases (Hotel DB, Elasticsearch, Redis, Cassandra).  
- **Fast Response Time**: CDN, caching (Redis), and Elasticsearch ensure low latency for search & booking.  
- **Fault Tolerance & Reliability**: Messaging queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) and replicated storage for stability & recovery.  
- **Data Archival & Analytics**: Cassandra stores booking data for archival; Hadoop supports large-scale analytics.

## 🎭 Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are **behavioral diagrams in UML** that visually represent interactions between users (actors) and a system (use cases).

### ✅ Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
1. **Clear Communication** – Visual summary of system functionality for all stakeholders.  
2. **User-Centered Design** – Highlights user interactions and goals.  
3. **Requirement Validation** – Maps use cases to requirements for accuracy.  
4. **Simplifies Complexity** – Breaks down large systems into user-focused tasks.  
5. **Supports Development Planning** – Helps identify modules, interfaces, and integration points.  
6. **Useful for Testing** – Provides a foundation for creating test cases.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

### 🌟 Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis
**Acceptance Criteria** are specific, measurable conditions that a product or feature must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders (clients, product owners, or end users).  
They bridge the gap between **business requirements** and **technical implementation**.  

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria: Checkout Process

These criteria ensure **secure payments, reliable confirmations, and robust error handling** in the booking system.  

#### 💳 Payment Processing
- System must accept: **Credit Card, Debit Card, Digital Wallets**.  
- All payment data must be **encrypted** during transmission & storage.  

#### 🏨 Booking Confirmation
- After successful payment:  
  - A **unique booking ID** is generated.  
  - Confirmation is **emailed** and **displayed on-screen**.  

#### ⚠️ Error Handling
- On payment failure:  
  - Show an **error message** explaining the issue.  
  - Allow **retry** without losing booking details.  

#### ⏳ Transaction Timeout
- Payment must **timeout after 5 minutes of inactivity**.  
- User prompted to **restart checkout**.  

#### 🔄 Booking Status Update
- On success:  
  - Booking status updates to **“Confirmed”** in **DB & cache**.  

#### 🔐 Security Compliance
- Checkout must comply with **PCI-DSS standards** for secure payment handling.
